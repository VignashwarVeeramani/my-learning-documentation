## What is Ethical Investing? 🤔

Ethical investing, often called **ESG** (**E**nvironmental, **S**ocial, and **G**overnance) investing, involves selecting companies that meet certain standards of social and environmental responsibility.

For investors focused on **"ethical"** and **"cruelty-free"** principles, these funds typically screen out and exclude companies involved in:
* Fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas)
* Gambling and tobacco
* Weapons manufacturing
* Animal cruelty (e.g., live animal export, non-medical animal testing)
* Poor human rights or environmental records
