# KRA 2 – Technical Leadership & Mentoring

## Technical / Leadership Questions

### 1. How do you mentor junior developers?
*   **S:** On the NPP and EMS projects at NAB, we had several junior developers joining the microservices teams.
*   **T:** My goal was to quickly bring them up to speed and ensure high-quality code delivery.
*   **A:** I conducted regular pair programming sessions, did code reviews emphasizing best practices, shared design documents, and held knowledge-sharing sessions for services like **Account Identifier MS** and **Branch Info**.
*   **R:** Junior developers became confident in delivering code independently, code quality improved, and incident rates dropped by 30%.

### 2. Can you give an example of enforcing coding standards and best practices?
*   **S:** During the mainframe-to-microservices migration, different developers were using inconsistent patterns for REST APIs.
*   **T:** Standardize coding practices across teams.
*   **A:** I introduced a common API development guide, created shared libraries for error handling and logging, and enforced standards through pull request checks.
*   **R:** This led to consistent, high-quality APIs, reduced rework, and made it easier for developers to switch between services.
