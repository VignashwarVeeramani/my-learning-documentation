# How to Use an AI Assistant with this Docusaurus Project

This guide provides a step-by-step workflow for using an AI assistant to create, update, and manage documentation within this Docusaurus repository. Following these steps will help the AI understand the project structure and perform tasks efficiently.

## 1. Setting the Context (The First and Most Important Step)

Before you ask the AI to make any changes, you must provide it with the context of the entire project. This allows the AI to understand the file structure and how different parts of the application work together.

### Initial Prompt Example:

Start your conversation with the AI using a prompt like this. This is a one-time setup for your conversation.

> "Hello! I need your help managing my Docusaurus documentation project. You are an expert developer assistant.
> 
> **Project Root:** `C:/my-learning-documentation/`
> 
> **Key Files & Directories:**
> - **`docs/`**: This is the main folder containing all the documentation in Markdown (`.md`) files. It is organized into subdirectories by topic, such as `java`, `springboot`, `python`, `docker`, etc.
> - **`sidebars.js`**: This file is critical. It controls the navigation sidebar for the entire website. Most sidebars are configured to be **autogenerated**, which means they automatically reflect the folder structure inside the `docs/` directory.
> - **`docusaurus.config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for the Docusaurus site.
>
> Your main tasks will be to create, read, and update Markdown files within the `docs/` directory. Please work in small, iterative steps and ask for clarification if needed."

## 2. Workflow: Creating a New Documentation Section

Here is a practical example of how to ask the AI to create a new set of documentation pages. Let's imagine you want to add a new section about "Kubernetes Basics" under a new top-level category.

### Step 2.1: User Request

Provide a clear and specific request.

> "I want to create a new documentation section for 'Kubernetes'. Please start by creating a new folder named `kubernetes` inside the `docs` directory. Then, create an introductory file named `introduction.md` inside it with a simple 'Hello Kubernetes' message."

### Step 2.2: AI Actions (What to Expect)

1.  The AI should confirm the path and create the new folder: `C:/my-learning-documentation/docs/kubernetes/`.
2.  The AI should then create the new file with the requested content: `C:/my-learning-documentation/docs/kubernetes/introduction.md`.

### Step 2.3: Updating the Sidebar

Now, you need to make the new section appear in the website's sidebar.

> "Great. Now, please add a new sidebar for the 'Kubernetes' section in the `sidebars.js` file. It should be autogenerated from the `kubernetes` directory."

### AI Actions (What to Expect)

The AI should read `sidebars.js`, add a new entry for `kubernetesSidebar`, and then write the updated content back to the file.

**Example of the change in `sidebars.js`:**

```javascript
// @ts-check

/** @type {import('@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs').SidebarsConfig} */
const sidebars = {
  // ... other sidebars ...
  dockerSidebar: [
    {type: 'autogenerated', dirName: 'docker'},
  ],
  // This is the new entry the AI should add
  kubernetesSidebar: [
    {type: 'autogenerated', dirName: 'kubernetes'},
  ],
   asxSidebar: [
      {type: 'autogenerated', dirName: 'asx-stocks'},
    ],
};

export default sidebars;
```

*Note: The AI might also need to update `docusaurus.config.js` to link this new sidebar to the navbar, but for simplicity, this example focuses on the core content and sidebar structure.*

## 3. Workflow: Modifying an Existing File

To modify an existing file, simply tell the AI which file to edit and what changes to make.

### User Request Example:

> "In the file `C:/my-learning-documentation/docs/kubernetes/introduction.md`, please add a new section explaining what a Pod is."

## 4. Running and Testing Locally

After the AI has made the changes, you should always run the Docusaurus development server to preview them before committing your code.

### Steps to Run:

1.  **Install Dependencies** (only needs to be done once):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

3.  **Preview Your Site**:
    Open your web browser and navigate to **`http://localhost:3000`**. You should see your new "Kubernetes" section in the sidebar and be able to view your new pages.

By following this structured approach, you can effectively guide the AI to build and maintain your documentation with accuracy and efficiency.
